# Create a Three.js rendered cube in React.

This project was built as a 101 introduction to Three.js. Following a few tutorials I built out this project to get a basic understanding of Three.js and how it can interact with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
